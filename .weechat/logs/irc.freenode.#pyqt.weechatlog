2014-05-08 22:46:02	Fresh-George	Sorry I was looking for more informations on internet. I'm new in PyQt and Qt in general and i need to implement a chat client but each messages is an object which contain some informations. My question is what is the best way to display these messages? Use a TextBrowser or create a new class which implement QAbstractItemView and use the Model/View programming way ?
2014-05-08 22:46:26	Fresh-George	Sorry for my english it's my natve language
2014-05-08 22:50:24	The-Compiler	Fresh-George: you probably mean "it's NOT my native language" ;)
2014-05-08 22:51:21	The-Compiler	Fresh-George: Hmm, you could indeed do an ItemView. Or use something like a QTextEdit or even QWebView.
2014-05-08 22:51:22	Fresh-George	yes ^^
2014-05-08 22:54:08	Fresh-George	Yes the items views looks great but from the designer there are 4 of them and i'm not sure they can be used for chat or maybe ListView.
2014-05-08 22:54:35	The-Compiler	I wonder how Quassel does this
2014-05-08 22:54:39	The-Compiler	(IRC client in Qt)
2014-05-08 22:56:17	Fresh-George	Ok I will search how they do that in Quassel thank you.
2014-05-08 22:57:54	The-Compiler	seems they use a QGraphicsView with an QAbstractItemModel

2014-05-08 22:58:11	The-Compiler	chat*.cpp
2014-05-08 23:04:17	Fresh-George	Thank you your help I will search documentation on how to use these new elements.
2014-05-08 23:04:38	Fresh-George	for your help*
2014-05-08 23:21:08	david_boddie	I think one of my colleagues used a QTextBrowser in a chat client.
