2014-05-07 19:39:07	sebastianlutter	I have problems with 14.04 amd64 desktop with nouveau and a nvidia gt 220m (laptop). When I unplug the laptop and start using firefox or chromium then after some minutes the screen freezes or it shows distorted screen. Because it does not happen when the laptop uses cable power instead of battery I guess it is a power saving issuse with my GPU.

2014-05-07 23:31:58	SAKUJ0	Hi, I don't know where to start. I have Ubuntu 14.04. I have my LED-TV hooked up via HDMI. When I turn off my TV (while in Xubuntu/XFCE) and turn it back on, I get no HDMI signal. Only if I swap to TTY1-6 (consoles) I get a signal and have to restart lightdm. This problem does not occur if I select XBMC as a session (I can turn off my TV and turn it on later and still be in XBMC). What could cause this?

It seems to be installed (I used apt-get firmware-b43-installer command). When I run ifconfig I can see wlan0 but no packets are received or sent. I hope somebody can help me. Marius

2014-05-08 04:20:38	Pessimist	Octavian95, you don't need to install any extra drivers. The free driver is perfectly fine and functional. You can see the feature matrix here: http://xorg.freedesktop.org/wiki/RadeonFeature/. Your gpu is r300. Optionally you should upgrade to 14.04 because they will probably be better. Unity is probably too heavy weight for you machine since it's using x200m. Consider switching to lxde/xfce or something else lighter.

In the install screen, Disk Setup, I get an option to Guided, use entire disk (several options), and manual. If I choose manual, do I then simply select the unallocated space, make it Primary, and mount point is / ?

2014-05-08 22:10:02	Player	Hi, I have a VPS running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with vncserver on it, whenever I start it up things seem to be fine and dandy.  I get a few things running, do updates, and whatnot then leave it.  For example I left it last night, when I try to log in this morning it gives me the message "Too many security failures!"  I logged onto the server with PuTTY and looked in ~/.vnc/, opened the log with mono and I see my connection being listed as 0.0.0.0:s
2014-05-08 22:10:02	Player	omeobscureport, then sometime around the middle of the night there was 0.0.0.0:anotherobscureport trying to log in, but failing to do so. This has been an issue for about two weeks now..  Anyone have any ideas?

I left it last night around midnight, when I try to log in this morning it gives me the message "Too many security failures!"  I logged onto the server with PuTTY and opened the log in ~/.vnc/ with mono and I see my connection being listed as 0.0.0.0:obscureport, then a few hours later,
2014-05-08 22:31:15	Player	0.0.0.0:anotherobscureport is logged attempting to log in, but failing to do so.  This has been an issue for about two weeks now, I'm not sure if this other IP that's failing authentication is a malicious attack attempt or what, but my password's so cryptic it would take a bruteforcer millions of years to get it.  Anyone have any ideas?

I did some searching on ubuntu forums and I see others having this issue but no resolutions.

I have not found this issue on the forums. Are these know issues wit

2014-05-09 07:07:51	soundjack	hi everyone, I'm having problems installing ubuntu on a new machine (AMD A10 7700k + motherboard Asrock FM288X ITX+)… I boot with a live USB into "try mode" and then install from there, although I have to add "nomodeset" when booting from the USB otherwise it just hangs. After installing Ubuntu doesn't boot and gives me a purple screen followed by a black one… I suspect it's the graphics drivers but how can I add "nomodeset" to the installed Ubuntu?

2014-05-09 07:26:30	andreas_secondar	UbuntuBoy, an operating system is only the ground beneath your feet of what you want to do. A good OS assists and doesn't impede your goals. A bad one slows you down. Just think of something you want to do.. and see if you can.  Suggestions, learn about and use ZFS. It is the filesystem of the future, and it runs well and stable on Ubuntu. Backup your data if you value your time.
